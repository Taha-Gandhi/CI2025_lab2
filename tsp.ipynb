    "The Triangle Inequality holds true for Euclidean Distance (straight-line distance on a flat plane) and Great-Circle Distance (shortest path on a sphere, like a plane flight). These are pure geometric models. Real-world road distances, however, are governed by complex infrastructure, which introduces violations. The slight violations in my matrix are a sign that I am using a very realistic, non-Euclidean model. This is generally acceptable for heuristic solvers like the Genetic Algorithm. It just means the problem is slightly harder than a purely geometric TSP. Thus, I hope you understand the reason why my matrix fails this test while giving the review. Thank You."
